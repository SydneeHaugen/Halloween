                <h2>Why October 31st?</h2>
                <p>Halloween is celebrated on October 31st because it aligns with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, marking the end of the harvest 
                   and the start of winter. The Celts believed that on this night, the boundary between the living and the spirit world was thinnest, 
                   making it a prime time for ghostly encounters.

                <h2>Medieval Trick-or-Treating</h2>
                <p>The origins of trick-or-treating date back to medieval times as

                    in costumes, performing songs or poems in exchange for food or coins.
