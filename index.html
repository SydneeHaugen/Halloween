                <h2>Halloween’s Ancient Origins</h2>
                <p>Halloween traces back over 2,000 years to the
                    Celtic festival of Samhain. Celebrated in early November, 
                    Samhain marked the end of the harvest and the thinning veil 
                    between the living and spirit worlds. People lit bonfires and
                    wore costumes to ward off ghosts, a tradition rooted in ancient 
                    Ireland, the UK, and France.

                <h2>Medieval Trick-or-Treating</h2>
                <p>The origins of trick-or-treating date back to medieval times as 
                    “guising” in Scotland and Ireland. Young people would go door-to-door
                    in costumes, performing songs or poems in exchange for food or coins. 
                    Today, the tradition lives on with children collecting candy — though singing is optional!
